# is-matt-gray-bigger-than-you

Nodejs-powered Twitter Bot that answers the age old question: "is Matt Gray bigger than me?".

This was created as a sort of joke response to [this Park Bench video](https://youtu.be/SborjlpiYtQ?t=198).

For a while, it was deployed to Heroku and ran under the [@namedculprit](https://twitter.com/namedculprit) account, but I shut it down due to free tier limitations and nobody really caring anymore. But hey! It was a fun learning experience.

If for some reason you want to actually run this, make sure to include your twitter api credentials as these environment variables:
```
CONSUMER_KEY
CONSUMER_SECRET
ACCESS_TOKEN
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
```
